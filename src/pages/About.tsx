                <h2>My Approach</h2>
                <p>
                  As an integrative therapist, I draw from different theories and approaches, tailoring my work to suit each client's unique needs. I believe in the healing power of a strong therapeutic relationship based on trust, empathy, and respect.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  My core training is psychodynamic, meaning I consider how past experiences may influence present difficulties. I have trained in Gestalt Therapy, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Transactional Analysis. I also incorporate elements of person-centred therapy, existential approaches, and attachment theory.
